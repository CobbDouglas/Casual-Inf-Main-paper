## Introduction

-It's own thing, a quick intro, not too long Lang 2013- Use this section as a theorical framework/ Intro Talk about

## Legislation

Pairity Laws- Use this is more detail about pairity laws ##Literature-

More detail for paper surrounding mental health/ pairity laws Pairity Laws "Toothless Bill" ##Data and Describtive Statitistics

How insurance companies were avoiding restrictions using limits on both mental and medical care and other such methods

the Big Signal- How it motivated states to implement heterogenous policy parity laws to stay ahead of federal overight

\- the 2000 GAO report

-The history and politicans Senator Domenici, Wellstone, Pete Stark

â€” "The result of this reform movement is that, by August 2001, fewer than a dozen states did not have some form of mental health parity legislation.'\^'' The MHPA may have encouraged this state legislative activity in at least two ways: by highlighting the issue of mental health parity\^\^ and by providing an incentive for states to head off federal regulatory oversight by enacting laws that were either comparable to the federal law or more comprehensive."

## Methods

Diff in Diff Matching / IPW with doubly robust estimators Hetero Diff in Diff

## Results

## Discussion

What does the balance of evidence come up to? It's probably close to Zero the percentage reduction. Do some back of the hand math.

## Conclusions

### Figures

#### Checklist for Figures I need.

-   *Copy Figure 1 from Lang*

    -   not done

-   Table 2 from me

    -   done

-   *Created Table 3*

    -   done

-   FE Table 4

    -   done

-   *First Difference Table 5*

    -   done

-   Matching Regressions \*

    -   Done I think. The Did Regressions are tabled and labled except for what algo they are using.

-   Matching Plots \*

    -   not happening unless you want 10 graphs

-   Event study PLOTS Not table that's dumb \*

    -   not done - I just need to save the plots already created.

-   For the CS Did Estimates, it's likely better just to produce graphs of each of the dynamic effects printed out of each regression you run References

note:

MHPA December 31 2003- Federal Law turns off

all laws are state guided after this point

Look into ERISA on self insured plans

-   fifty-six million americans at the time.
