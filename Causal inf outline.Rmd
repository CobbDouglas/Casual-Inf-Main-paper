## Introduction

-   Note: Look over results and make sure sigficant stars are assigned correctly. The inital DID tables don't have them.

-It's own thing, a quick intro, not too long Lang 2013- Use this section as a theorical framework/ Intro

What is the punch line?

-   I find statistically significant effects in traditional inference methods while for the heterousgenous results leave me unconvinced of a significant effect.

-   Reason why we care: A lot like how a doctor might follow up on a patient after treatment, economists also care whether a particular policy was instrumental in delivering on it's promises. This wave of parity legislation was championed being the next step in progressive healthcare in the years before the passing of the Affordable Care Act. I largely find that while it does (survive initial robustness checks)\*\*(Double check if this is true) a slightly more modern analysis provides a new lens.

## Legislation

Pairity Laws- Use this is more detail about pairity laws ##Literature-

More detail for paper surrounding mental health/ pairity laws Pairity Laws "Toothless Bill" ##Data and Describtive Statitistics

How insurance companies were avoiding restrictions using limits on both mental and medical care and other such methods

the Big Signal- How it motivated states to implement heterogenous policy parity laws to stay ahead of federal overight

\- the 2000 GAO report

-The history and politicans Senator Domenici, Wellstone, Pete Stark

— "The result of this reform movement is that, by August 2001, fewer than a dozen states did not have some form of mental health parity legislation.'\^'' The MHPA may have encouraged this state legislative activity in at least two ways: by highlighting the issue of mental health parity\^\^ and by providing an incentive for states to head off federal regulatory oversight by enacting laws that were either comparable to the federal law or more comprehensive."

## Methods

Diff in Diff Matching / IPW with doubly robust estimators Hetero Diff in Diff

## Results

## Discussion

What does the balance of evidence come up to? It's probably close to Zero the percentage reduction. Do some back of the hand math.

## Conclusions

### Figures

#### Checklist for Figures I need.

-   *Copy Figure 1 from Lang*

    -   not done

-   Table 2 from me

    -   done

-   *Created Table 3*

    -   done

-   FE Table 4

    -   done

-   *First Difference Table 5*

    -   done

-   Matching Regressions \*

    -   Done I think. The Did Regressions are tabled and labled except for what algo they are using.

-   Matching Plots \*

    -   not happening unless you want 10 graphs

-   Event study PLOTS Not table that's dumb \*

    -   not done - I just need to save the plots already created.

-   For the CS Did Estimates, it's likely better just to produce graphs of each of the dynamic effects printed out of each regression you run References

note:

MHPA December 31 2003- Federal Law turns off

all laws are state guided after this point

Look into ERISA on self insured plans

-   fifty-six million americans at the time.
