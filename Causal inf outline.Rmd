### Figures

#### Checklist for Figures I need.

-   *Copy Figure 1 from Lang*

    -   not done

-   Table 2 from me

    -   done

-   *Created Table 3*

    -   done

-   FE Table 4

    -   done

-   *First Difference Table 5*

    -   done

-   Matching Regressions \*

    -   Done I think. The Did Regressions are tabled and labled except for what algo they are using.

-   Matching Plots \*

    -   not happening unless you want 10 graphs

-   Event study PLOTS Not table that's dumb \*

    -   not done - I just need to save the plots already created.

-   For the CS Did Estimates, it's likely better just to produce graphs of each of the dynamic effects printed out of each regression you run References
