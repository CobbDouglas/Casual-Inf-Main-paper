### Hoping this is something that fixes what we got here. 
### Things to do 
###  * append/merge each year of data into a big excel sheet and append that into our data
###  Taking "Large business datasheet" into years of data with TOTAL and firms that are 500+
### * implement a timing control ydelta basically
### * It's not just the LBD but also states 2006_2021 that need to be appended together. 
### Removed all state related dataframes that were already in the Masterdataset. 
### 2/20/24 
### This is a new script that should act as a script that when run, produces the entire paper's results
