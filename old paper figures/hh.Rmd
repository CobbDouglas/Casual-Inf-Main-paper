## What are Insurance Parity laws?

-   Parity means that when comparing two health plans, they have the same terms and conditions for mental health care as they do physical care.

-   Persons covered will use services available to them that might lead to less suicides.

## Previous Research/ Replication Paper

-   The Impact of Mental Health Insurance Laws on state Suicide Rates

    -   by Matthew Lang

-   Main findings

    -   Used DiD to find the wave of passing insurance parity laws lead to less suicides

        -   Reduced Suicides by 4%.

-   Performed Several Robustness checks

    -   Event-study analysis

    -   Age-specfic results

    -   Mortality trends

## Lang 2011's summary stats

![](sum%20stats%20for%20Matthew%20Lang.PNG)

## Main Methods

-   Lang ran one main DiD while also making comparisons

    -   One DiD was ran after the passing of 1996 Federal Mental Health Parity Act

    -   The other after 2008 Mental Health Parity Act.

        -   Consistent results: Regressions had the effect pegged at 4-7% using two-way fixed effects

## My Methods

-   Unfortunately for us, the grounds where we can infer conclusions has gotten shakier i.e Goodman-Bacon, Sant'Anna, etc etc.

-   To build on top of Lang's work, We need to delineate more between our control and treatment, meaning:

-   placebo tests

    -   Gendered Response?

-   propensity score matching.

    -   Pulling treatment closer to treatment and control closer to control.
